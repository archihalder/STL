# Standard Template Library (STL)

The Standard Template Library (STL) is a set of C++ template classes to provide common programming data structures and functions such as lists, stacks, arrays, etc. It is a library of container classes, algorithms, and iterators.

## STL Algorithms

1. Sort
2. Binary Search
3. Lower Bound and Upper Bound
4. Maximum and Minimum
5. Rotate
6. Swap
7. Reverse

## STL Containers

1. <b>Sequence Containers</b> - Data Structures which can be accessed in a sequential manner

   - Vector
   - List
   - Deque
   - Array

2. <b>Container Adaptors</b> - Provides a different interface for sequential containers

   - Stack
   - Queue
   - Priority Queue

3. <b>Associative Containers</b> - Data Structures that can be quickly searched (O(log n) complexity)

   - Set
   - Map

4. <b>Unordered Associative Containers</b> - Unordered Data Structures that can be quickly searched
   - Unordered Set
   - Unordered Map
